                     GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                        Version 3, 19 November 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                         Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free software license
that guarantees end users the freedom to run, study, share, and modify
the software. In addition, it ensures that users who interact with the
software over a network have access to the source code. This is
important for software that is often used as a service.

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU Affero General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all
versions of a program—to make sure it is free software for all its
users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software and use pieces of it
in new free programs, and that you are informed that you can do these
things.

Thus, the central idea of the Affero General Public License is to
ensure that the software remains free for all its users.

                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

   This License refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public
   License. The "Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed
   under this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees"
   and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations. To "modify"
   the Program means to copy from it or adapt it to new uses. To "propagate"
   it means to make copies of it, with or without modifications, and
   to make available copies to the public.

1. Source Code.

   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work
   for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source
   form of a work. A "Standard Interface" means an interface
   that is standard in the community. The "Program" must include a
   copy of this license.

2. Basic Permissions.

   You are permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of the
   Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided
   that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
   appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that
   this License applies to the Program; and keep intact all notices
   of the absence of any warranty; and that you distribute a copy of
   this License along with the Program.

3. Copyleft.

   You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
   of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
   distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 2
   above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

   a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
   stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

   b) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge
   to all third parties under the terms of this License.

   c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
   when run, you must cause it, when started running for such an
   interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
   announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
   that there is no warranty (or else saying that you provide a warranty)
   and that users may redistribute the program under these terms,
   and how to get the source code. (Exception: if the Program itself
   is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,
   your modified version may not be required to print an announcement.)

4. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
   the Program, under the terms of Section 3 provided that you also
   meet all of these conditions:

   a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
   stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

   b) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge
   to all third parties under the terms of this License.

   c) You must preserve all of the notices that refer to this License
   and to the absence of any warranty; and you must give any other
   recipients of the Program or the modified version a copy of this
   License along with the Program.

   d) You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of
   the rights granted or affirmed under this License. You are not
   responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this
   License.

5. Conveying Non Source Forms.

   You may convey a work based on the Program in object code form under
   the terms of this License, provided that you also do one of the
   following:

   a) Convey the complete corresponding machine-readable source code
   of the work under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

   i)  Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
   source code, which must be distributed under the terms of this License; or,

   ii)  Provide access to copy the complete corresponding machine-readable
   source code from a designated place (this is usually a designated
   website, but can also be another place that is reasonably
   accessible without charge); or,

   iii)  Offer to provide, for a charge no more than your cost of
   performing this distribution, a complete corresponding machine-readable
   source code to the recipients of the non-source form of the work,
   in which case you must accompany it with a written offer to provide
   the corresponding source code.

   b) You must ensure that the source code corresponds to the version
   of the object code that you are distributing, in that you must not
   make modifications to the source code that are not reflected in the
   object code.

6. Application of this License.

   The GNU Affero General Public License applies to the work as a whole.
   It is not possible to apply this License to only part of the work.
   If you want to incorporate parts of this Program into other free
   programs whose distribution terms are different, write to the author
   to ask for permission.

7. Combination of this License with Other Licenses.

   The GNU Affero General Public License is intended to guarantee your
   freedom to share and change all versions of a program—to make sure
   it is free software for all its users. Therefore, you cannot impose
   any further restrictions on the rights granted by this License.

8. Termination.

   You may not propagate or modify a version of the Program that you
   have received from a previous licensee except as permitted under
   this License. However, if you cease all distribution of the Program
   or of works based on it, your license under this License automatically
   terminates.

9. Future Versions.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
   of the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new
   versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
   differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version
   is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies
   that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General Public License
   "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following
   the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any
   later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program
   does not specify a version number of the GNU Affero General Public
   License, you may choose any version of this License ever published
   by the Free Software Foundation.

10. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
   run a copy of the Program. However, nothing else grants you
   permission to modify or propagate the Program or its derivative
   works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept
   this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating the Program
   (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
   this License to do so.

11. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

   Each time you propagate the Program or a work based on the Program,
   the recipients automatically receive a license from the original
   licensors to run, study, share and modify the Program subject to
   this License. You may not impose any further restrictions on the
   exercise of the rights granted by the original licensors. You are
   not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this
   License.

12. Disclaimer of Warranty.

   The Program is provided without any warranty of any kind, either
   express or implied, including but not limited to the implied
   warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.
   The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Program
   is with you. Should the Program prove defective, you assume the
   cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.

13. Limitation of Liability.

   In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
   writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who modifies
   and/or conveys the Program, be liable to you for damages, including
   any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising
   out of the use or inability to use the Program (including but not
   limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses
   sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the Program to
   operate with any other programs), even if such holder or other party
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

14. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

   If the distribution and use of the Program are restricted in certain
   countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the Free
   Software Foundation will not grant you the permission to distribute
   the Program in those countries. The Free Software Foundation will not
   be liable for any damages arising from your failure to comply with
   the conditions of this License.

15. Severability.

   If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be struck out and the remaining provisions shall
   remain in effect.

16. Termination of this License.

   You may terminate this License by notifying the Free Software Foundation
   in writing. However, if you distribute the Program or a work based on
   the Program after termination of this License, the termination will
   not be effective.

17. Miscellaneous.

   This License is governed by the laws of the United States and the
   state of Massachusetts.
